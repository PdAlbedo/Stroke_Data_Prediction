# Prediction of stroke based on various models
#### Group member: Xichen Liu, Duo Zhao, Keming Xu, Wenshu Yang, Rodolph Mesadieu

we will be building a couple of machine learning models to make predictions on whether a patient 
is likely to get a stroke, using the dataset of a number of patientsâ€™ body data, 
like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status, etc.<br>
Making the predictions by building various models.<br>

* **Process**
  * Preprocessing data
  * EDA
  * Model selection
  * Modelling
  * Conclusion
* **Models to use**
  * Logistic regression
  * SVM
  * K-nearest Neighbor classifier
  * Decision Tree classifier
  * Random Forest classifier
  * Naive Bayes classifier
  * etc.
